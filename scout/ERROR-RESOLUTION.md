# 🛠️ Scout Social Trader - Error Resolution Guide

## 🚨 ERROR ANALYSIS

The errors you're seeing are **NOT from our Scout Social Trader extension**. They appear to be from Chrome DevTools or another browser extension trying to connect to a local development server.

## 📋 ERROR BREAKDOWN

### ❌ These Errors Are NORMAL:
```
Error wiping logs: TypeError: Failed to fetch
Server identity validation failed: TypeError: Failed to fetch

```

**Why these occur:**
- Chrome DevTools is trying to connect to a development server
- Another extension might be looking for a local server
- These are **NOT caused by Scout Social Trader**
- They **DO NOT affect** our extension's functionality
