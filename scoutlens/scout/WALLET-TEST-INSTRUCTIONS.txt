🔗 SCOUT WALLET CONNECTION - TEST INSTRUCTIONS
=====================================================

✅ NEW IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!

The MetaMask connection now uses a popup window that runs in page context,
allowing proper access to window.ethereum that MetaMask injects.

   - Click Scout extension icon
   - Click "🦊 Connect MetaMask" button
   - A popup window will open
   - Complete connection in the popup window
   - Window will auto-close on success

3. **What Should Happen**:
   ✅ Popup window opens with Scout wallet connection UI
   ✅ MetaMask detection works properly
   ✅ Connection request shows in MetaMask
   ✅ Success message appears and window closes
   ✅ Main Scout popup shows connected state
