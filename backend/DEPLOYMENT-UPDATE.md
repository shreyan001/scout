## For Railway Deployment

1. **Commit your changes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Update API responses to structured format for frontend consumption"
```

2. **Push to your repository:**
```bash
git push origin main
```

3. **Railway will automatically redeploy** (if connected to your Git repository)

## Key Changes Made:

### ✅ **Response Format Fixed**

## Testing Your Deployed API:

After deployment, test with:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://scout-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/process" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "man I want some DOGE"}'
```

Expected structured response format with essential data only!
